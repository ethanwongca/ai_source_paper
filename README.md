# Gen AI to determine a paper is a source paper (Proof of Concept)
 Using Gen AI we determine whether or not a paper is a source paper or a literature review. 

## Languages 
**Languages**: CSS, HTML, Python, Bash, Git
**Technologies**: Google Gemini API, GROBID, Flask, SQLite

## Why
I wanted to make a quick app that takes a pdf, scans it, and then output whether it is a source paper or not quickly. I also wanted to try out Google's Gemini API
